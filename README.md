# Project Overview

Single page website which used to serve as my primary portfolio site. I made it relying on CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts for the styling, and pure JavaScript for the navigation links interaction and to lazy-load the images. Specifically, I used the new Intersection Observer API to keep track of the user's scrolling and to load the images when needed. More information [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).
